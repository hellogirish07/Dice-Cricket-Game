            <h1>Dice Cricket Game</h1>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Dice Cricket</strong> is a fun and simple game based on cricket, where two players (a batsman and a
            bowler) take turns rolling a dice to play the game. Here’s how it works:</p>

        <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The game consists of two innings, one where the batsman plays and one where the bowler plays.</li>
            <li>The player who bats rolls a dice, and the player who bowls rolls a dice as well.</li>
            <li>If the bowler’s dice number is greater than the batsman’s number, the batsman is OUT.</li>
            <li>If the batsman’s dice number is greater, the batsman’s score increases by the value of the dice roll.
            </li>
            <li>Each player gets to roll the dice for 6 times (1 over), and after 6 rolls, the turn switches.</li>
            <li>Once both players have had their turn to bat, the scores are compared, and the player with the highest
                score wins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Play:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter names for the batsman and bowler.</li>
            <li>Choose how many overs (1 to 5) you want to play.</li>
            <li>Click on "Start Game" to begin.</li>
            <li>Click on "Roll Dice" to play each turn.</li>
            <li>After both players finish their turn, the winner will be announced.</li>
        </ol>
